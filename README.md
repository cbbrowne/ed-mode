# ed for Emacs

ed-mode lets you interact with Emacs buffers like you would do with
the ed editor.

## Installation

Make sure that `ed-mode.el` is in your `load-path`, then add
`(require 'ed)` to your init file.

## Usage

Use ed by opening a file like you’d normally do, and then do:
<kbd>M‑x</kbd> ed <kbd>RET</kbd>
